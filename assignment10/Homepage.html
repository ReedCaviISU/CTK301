			<h2>Welcome!</h2>
			<p class="paragraph">Hi! My name's Reed. I am a sophomore at Illinois State University. My first passion in life is Photography. I love photography because
			you can explore many different genres to try out for yourself and you can always try something new. I've been doing photography for about six or seven years.
		 	It all started in high school when my art teacher sai that he'll be teaching us about digital and fiml photography. At that moment I knew I was instantly hooked.
			I always wanted to learn about photography and learn more about the camera in general, so I was super extatic to have the oppurtunity to work with photography all throughout high school
			and that's where it became one of my passions.</p>
